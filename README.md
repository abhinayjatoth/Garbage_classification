# Classification of Garbage into Multiple Categories of Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Waste

## Learning Objective:
For this project we used 2 pre-trained CNN models(InceptionV3 and MobileNet) and a custom CNN model to classify 12 different types of garbage categories

Trained all the three models on google colab prpo

### The deliverables of the project are as follows
1. Source Code Colab files of CNN, MobileNet and InceptionV3 models in file : Garbage Classification - MobileNet and CNN, Garbage Classification - InceptionV3
2. Garbage dataset(12 classes)
3. IEEE format Final Report in pdf and doc

### Executing Instructions
- Add shared drive link shortcut or the dataset to your local drive
- Run both the colab files
